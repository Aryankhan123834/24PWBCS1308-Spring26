# Lab 01 Report

In this lab, I learned how to install and configure Git and Visual Studio Code. 
I practiced creating repositories, adding files, committing changes, and pushing them to GitHub. 
I also learned how to create branches and merge them into the main branch. 
This lab helped me understand version control and how developers manage projects efficiently.
